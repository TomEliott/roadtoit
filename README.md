# 🛣 Road To IT
## 🏆 Gold medal for the First Edition of the [Île-de-France Region Ambassador Contest](https://www.iledefrance.fr/trophees-des-etudiants-ambassadeurs-58-jeunes-recompenses)

### What is the purpose of “Road to IT” ?
I made this blog, Road to IT (*“Route vers l’informatique” in French*) as part of the contest [“Trophies student ambassadors of the Île-de-France Region”](https://www.iledefrance.fr/trophees-des-etudiants-ambassadeurs-58-jeunes-recompenses). The purpose of the contest is to present the higher education, research and innovation ecosystem of Île-de-France to foreign students and researchers, to encourage them to pursue their higher education and/or research work in Île-de-France. After the vote which took place in November 2019, my project won the Gold Medal of this first edition, I wanted to thank all those who helped me develop this blog and hope that it will still be of service to many foreign students !

I present here the main Computer Science courses offered by universities and specialized schools in Île-de-France, but also the incubators that make French startups and companies famous at the national, European and global levels. This is to give an overview of each course, without going into too much detail, by presenting the schools or incubators, how they work, their price, the benefits and give you the opportunity to make your own opinion in relation to your needs.
